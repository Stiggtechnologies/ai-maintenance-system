## Critical Recommendations

### ✅ DO IMMEDIATELY (This Week)

1. **Approve Budget** - Minimum $45K for Phase 1
2. **Assign Team** - Lock in frontend engineer, technical writer, support lead
3. **Start Onboarding Dev** - This is the critical path
4. **Sign Up for Intercom** - Lock in early-stage pricing ($200/mo)
5. **Publish Help Articles** - They're ready, just need screenshots

### ✅ DO BEFORE LAUNCH

1. **User Test Onboarding** - Get 10 beta users through the flow
2. **Demo Data Quality Check** - Ensure demo feels realistic
3. **Support Runbooks** - Train support team on common scenarios
4. **Email Domain Warming** - Start 2 weeks before launch
5. **Analytics Tracking** - Implement PostHog/Mixpanel for funnel

### ⚠️ DON'T SKIP

1. **Onboarding Flow Testing** - This makes or breaks first impression
2. **Demo Environment Isolation** - RLS policies must be bulletproof
3. **Help Center Launch** - Reduces support burden immediately
4. **Customer Health Tracking** - Know who's at risk early

### ❌ DON'T DO (Yet)

1. **Community Forum** - Too early, focus on core first
2. **Mobile App Development** - Help center mobile view is enough for now
3. **Localization** - English only for MVP
4. **Advanced Automation** - Manual processes OK initially

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK (Mitigate Now)

**Risk:** Onboarding flow development delayed  
**Impact:** Can't acquire customers  
**Mitigation:** Start Week 1, dedicated engineer, daily standups

**Risk:** Support overload  
**Impact:** Poor customer experience  
**Mitigation:** AI bot (40% deflection), comprehensive help center, hire support agent at 50 customers

### MEDIUM RISK (Monitor)

**Risk:** Demo data feels unrealistic  
**Impact:** Lower sales conversion  
**Mitigation:** Use real industry scenarios, iterate based on feedback

**Risk:** Video production delays  
**Impact:** Slower onboarding (help articles cover same content)  
**Mitigation:** Detailed scripts approved upfront, contract producer with deadline

### LOW RISK

**Risk:** Intercom cost overrun  
**Mitigation:** Lock in startup pricing, consider Plain as backup
