## Video Tutorial Scripts (5 Core Workflows)

### Video 1: Getting Started with SyncAI (8 minutes)

**Target Audience:** New users, all roles  
**Goal:** Complete onboarding in under 10 minutes  
**Recording Location:** Screen recording with voiceover

**Script:**

```
[00:00 - 00:30] INTRO
"Welcome to SyncAI! I'm Sarah, and in the next 8 minutes, 
I'll show you everything you need to get started with the 
world's most advanced AI-powered maintenance system.

By the end of this video, you'll have:
✓ Added your first asset
✓ Activated AI monitoring
✓ Created a work order
✓ And understood how our AI agents help you prevent failures

Let's dive in!"

[00:30 - 01:30] DASHBOARD OVERVIEW
[Show: Dashboard with demo data]

"This is your dashboard. Here's what you're looking at:

At the top, your key metrics:
- 47 assets being monitored
- 15 active work orders
- 87% uptime - that's excellent!
- And your maintenance costs for the month

On the left, real-time AI insights. These are your 15 AI 
agents constantly analyzing your equipment and alerting you 
to potential issues.

The center shows your asset health. Green is good, yellow 
means watch closely, red means take action now.

And on the right, recent activity - what's happening in 
your operation right now."

[01:30 - 03:00] ADDING YOUR FIRST ASSET
[Show: Assets page → + New Asset]

"Let's add your first asset. Click 'Assets' in the sidebar, 
then the '+ New Asset' button.

You have three options:
1. Manual entry - best for your first asset
2. CSV import - when you have a list ready
3. Demo data - if you want to explore first

Let's go with manual entry.

Four required fields:

Asset Name: Be specific. I'll enter 'Centrifugal Pump P-101'

Asset Type: Select from the dropdown. We have pumps, 
compressors, motors, heat exchangers, and more. I'll choose 
'Centrifugal Pump.'

Location: Where is this equipment? I'll enter 'Building A, 
Production Floor.'

Criticality: How important is this asset?
- Critical = Production stops if it fails
- High = Significant impact
- Medium = Scheduled downtime OK
- Low = Minimal impact

I'll mark this as 'High' priority.

Click 'Create Asset' and... boom! Your first asset is in 
the system."

[03:00 - 04:30] ACTIVATING AI MONITORING
[Show: Asset details → AI Monitoring toggle]

"Now here's where it gets powerful. Click on your asset to 
open details.

See this toggle? 'AI Monitoring.' Turn it ON.

What just happened? You unleashed 15 specialized AI agents 
to work on this asset 24/7:

- Reliability Engineering Agent predicts failures
- Condition Monitoring Agent watches sensor data
- Maintenance Strategy Agent optimizes schedules
- And 12 more!

Within an hour, you'll get your first health assessment.
Within 24 hours, AI establishes a baseline.
Within a week, you'll get predictive insights.

The more assets you add, the smarter the AI becomes."

[04:30 - 06:00] CREATING A WORK ORDER
[Show: AI insight → Create Work Order]

"Let's say the AI spots something. Go to 'AI Analytics' tab.

Here's a prediction: 'Bearing failure risk 68% within 30 
days.'

The AI is 92% confident about this. That's high confidence.

Click 'Create Work Order.' Watch this - SyncAI auto-fills 
everything:

- Title: 'Inspect and replace bearing on Pump P-101'
- Asset: Already linked
- Priority: Marked as 'High'
- Description: Full AI analysis with recommendations

All I need to do is:
- Assign it to a technician (I'll pick Mike)
- Set a due date (within 2 weeks, as AI suggested)
- Click 'Create'

And now Mike gets notified, the work is scheduled, and we 
just prevented a $45,000 failure with an $8,000 planned 
repair. That's the power of predictive maintenance."

[06:00 - 07:30] EXPLORING AI INSIGHTS
[Show: Dashboard → various AI recommendations]

"Let me show you some other AI insights you might see:

Here's the Inventory Management Agent saying we need to 
reorder spare parts.

The Compliance Agent reminds us a certification expires in 
30 days.

The Sustainability Agent found a way to save $45K and reduce 
emissions.

Every insight is actionable. Click to learn more, create a 
work order, or dismiss if not relevant.

And you can chat with JAVIS, our AI assistant. Click the 
chat icon and ask anything:
'What are my top failure risks this month?'
'Show maintenance history for Pump P-101'
'Calculate ROI from predictive maintenance'

It's like having a maintenance expert available 24/7."

[07:30 - 08:00] CLOSING & NEXT STEPS
"That's it! You're up and running with SyncAI.

Next steps:
1. Add more assets - the more, the better the predictions
2. Invite your team - Settings → Team Management
3. Set up alerts - Settings → Notifications
4. Explore the Help Center for detailed guides
