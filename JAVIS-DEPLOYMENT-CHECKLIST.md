2. âœ… Expect: Response with Site A info
3. Follow-up: "And Site B?"
4. âœ… Expect: Response maintains conversation context
5. Follow-up: "Compare them"
6. âœ… Expect: Comparison referencing previous turns
```

### **Test 7: Morning Briefing**
```
1. Navigate to: J.A.V.I.S â†’ Briefing

## Monitoring Setup

### **Database Queries to Monitor:**

```sql
-- Active WebSocket sessions
SELECT COUNT(*) as active_sessions
FROM javis_websocket_sessions
WHERE disconnected_at IS NULL;

-- Pending actions (should expire after 5 min)
SELECT COUNT(*) as pending_actions
FROM javis_pending_actions
WHERE expires_at > now();

-- Unprocessed events
SELECT COUNT(*) as queued_events
FROM javis_event_queue
WHERE NOT processed;

-- Tool execution success rate (last 24h)
SELECT
  tool_name,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'executed' THEN 1 END) as successful,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'executed' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 1) as success_pct
FROM javis_tool_executions
WHERE created_at > now() - interval '24 hours'
GROUP BY tool_name;
```

### **Alerts to Set Up:**

- [ ] Alert if unprocessed events > 100
- [ ] Alert if tool execution failure rate > 10%
- [ ] Alert if WebSocket disconnects > 5/minute
- [ ] Alert if conversation turn > 50 (possible loop)

---

## Production Hardening

### **Security:**
- [ ] Review RLS policies (users can only see own data)
- [ ] Audit tool permissions (correct roles assigned)
- [ ] Test with different user roles
- [ ] Verify tenant isolation (users can't see other tenants)
- [ ] Enable rate limiting on edge functions
- [ ] Add input validation for tool parameters

### **Performance:**
- [ ] Set up conversation context caching
- [ ] Add indexes on frequently queried columns
- [ ] Monitor WebSocket connection count
- [ ] Set max message size limit
- [ ] Implement conversation turn limit (prevent infinite loops)

### **Reliability:**
- [ ] Set up WebSocket auto-reconnect
- [ ] Add exponential backoff for retries
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation (fallback to REST if WS fails)
- [ ] Add dead letter queue for failed events
- [ ] Set up function error logging

---

## Cron Jobs to Schedule

### **Event Processing:**
```bash
# Process queued events every minute
*/1 * * * * curl -X POST \
  https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/javis-event-listener/process \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
```

### **Cleanup Tasks:**
```sql
-- Run daily at 2 AM: Clean up old conversations
DELETE FROM javis_conversations
WHERE ended_at < now() - interval '90 days';

-- Run daily at 2 AM: Clean up expired pending actions
DELETE FROM javis_pending_actions
WHERE expires_at < now();

-- Run daily at 2 AM: Clean up old WebSocket sessions
DELETE FROM javis_websocket_sessions
WHERE disconnected_at < now() - interval '7 days';
```

## User Onboarding

### **Step 1: Assign User Role**
```sql
INSERT INTO user_role_map (tenant_id, user_id, role_code, is_primary)
VALUES ('tenant-uuid', 'user-uuid', 'REL_ENG', TRUE);
```

### **Step 2: Set User Preferences**
```sql
INSERT INTO user_preferences (tenant_id, user_id, display_name, prefers_voice)
VALUES ('tenant-uuid', 'user-uuid', 'Orville', FALSE);
```

### **Step 3: User Test Checklist**
- [ ] User can open J.A.V.I.S dock
- [ ] User receives role-appropriate responses
- [ ] User can see only authorized tools
- [ ] User receives morning briefing
- [ ] User can set preferences

---

## Rollback Plan

### **If WebSocket Issues:**
1. Revert to `JavisDock` (non-WebSocket version)
2. Update App.tsx: `import { JavisDock } from './components/JavisDock'`
3. Users fall back to REST API polling

### **If Tool Execution Issues:**
1. Disable problematic tools:
   ```sql
   UPDATE javis_tool_definitions
   SET enabled = FALSE
   WHERE tool_name = 'problematic_tool';
   ```

### **If Event Processing Issues:**
1. Pause event ingestion
2. Process queue manually
3. Investigate and fix
4. Resume ingestion
